(Semi Broken/unfinished) Todo App!

Hello!

You task with this PhishMe homework is to fix the bugs and improve the application however you see fit along the way.
The main focus of this task is to improve the app with special attention to the state of the front end.  Feel free
to fix or update any related issues you see.  This was taken from a previous exercise and roughed up a bit to give
you plenty of options to work on.  Do not feel like you need to fix everything, but be strategic in your efforts to
improve the overall UI and flow of the app.

The specs are already all green and should still be green when you're finished.  While this exercise is focused
more on the front end, maintaining tests (and adding them where appropriate) is an important part of maintaining
an application.

Another note.  The beginning example for this used haml which we do not currently use in production.  It is irrelevant
for the sake of this exercise if you do your work in haml, erb, or anything else as long as the result works well.

Requirements:

* green test suite
* working application

Issues that need addressing

* navigation
* consistencies of style
* general UX

Bugs that need fixing

* duplicate project names are allowed
* project and task descriptions are not visible


These are just ideas, consider this your playground.  Anything you see that needs fixing is fair game.  If there are
bigger issues that need fixing but there is no time, record your thoughts and we can discuss them in the followup.

Please commit this in its initial state to a git repo somewhere (preferably publicly visible like github or bitbucket).
Commit as you work like you normally would and send us a link to the repo when it is ready for our review.  Please
let us know if you have any issues that are blocking you.
